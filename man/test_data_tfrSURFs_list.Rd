\format{
Data frames in the format produced by \code{\link{make_tfr_surfs}}.

An object of class \code{list} of length 3.
}
\source{
See \pkg{bayesTFR}. These results were based on parameter estimates and projections with 10 trajectories only.

\description{
Results of running \code{\link{make_tfr_surfs}} on very short,
\emph{definitely not converged} runs of \pkg{bayesTFR} functions, for small
subsets of countries.
\describe{
\item{\code{"test_data_tfrSURFs_list"}}{\code{\link{make_tfr_surfs}} applied to country codes: 12, 716, 508, 417, 764, 32, 250, 242.}
\item{\code{"test_data_small_c_tfrSURFs_list"}}{\code{\link{make_tfr_surfs}} applied to countries with less than country codes: 184, 212, 500.}
}
}
\details{
These need to be prepared during development and stored in \file{./data}
because they rely on a run of \pkg{bayesTFR} which is too big to distribute
with the package.
