\section{Changes}{


\subsection{Year ranges}{
This data dataset is in \dQuote{long}, or \dQuote{database} format: each row
corresponds to a separate country-year combination in the original. In the
original, some countries had overlapping year ranges (for example, Benin had
three entries with year ranges \dQuote{1996-2001}, \dQuote{2001-2006},
\dQuote{2006-2012}). This implied there was ambiguity over which stall the
year-range endpoints belonged to (if any). To resolve this, year ranges in the
original were read as closed on the left, open on the right i.e., [yyyy,
zzzz). For example, the period "1996-2001" was read as [1996, 2001) so that
1996 was recorded as belonging to this particular stall but 2001 was not.}

\subsection{Ghana 1998 DHS}{
The year ranges for following entries for Ghana
\preformatted{
    Country     Period     ...
    -------    ---------
    Ghana      1993-1999   ...
    Ghana      1999-2003   ...
}
where modified to \dQuote{1993-1998} and \dQuote{1998-2003} to reflect the
fact that the DHS in Ghana was conducted in 1998, not 1999. The modification
matches the information in Table 1 of the original journal article.
